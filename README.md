# quizzler
                                            Flutter quiz application forked in Angela's Yu course.

This was a simple code to explain us how to retrieve data from a list and do a little quizz about what can be pleasant to us.
The code was based on flutter 2.5.2 and dart 2.14.3


                                                        What was done in this work:
1. In the pubspec.yaml :
      - Add the library : rflutter_alert: ^2.0.2;
      - Download the lobster family and add it to the asset folder

2. We have 3 classes in the lib folder:
      - main.dart : the main code;
      - question_List.dart;
      - questions_answers.dart;
All the functionality of these classes are detailed on their files.

3. The main purposes of this code are:
      - Create a list of questions and have the possibility to print them in the card (main.dart);
      - Display the historic of scores down to keep track of them;
      - Create a little animation on the score : when the answer is good, the border of the scorer goes green to black and in the case of an false answer, the scorer                                                goes red to black.
